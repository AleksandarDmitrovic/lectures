# React Next Steps

Hey Everyone, 

Today we covered a lot.  

Remember the first 'next steps' for you should be to review the work you have done with react so far and brush up on some of the concepts you know. Dan Abramov has some great articles on react in particular [this one](https://overreacted.io/a-complete-guide-to-useeffect/) helped a lot with my understanding of functional react.  

Try to think of the other content we covered in lecture as an exploration of things possible with react. Less a tutorial on how to use those things. 
The project we made together can be found [here](https://github.com/tborsa/react-next-steps/tree/master/src)

We looked at (links included):

- [new hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usecontext)
  - useContext 
  - useRef

- [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/quick-start)
  - Router
  - Params
  - History
  - Switch

And talked about:

- React component libraries/ react libraries
  - component libraries for stylized UI
  - component libraries for functional specific things
  - examples [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/), [Ant design](https://ant.design/)

- [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/tutorial)

- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/introduction/getting-started)
