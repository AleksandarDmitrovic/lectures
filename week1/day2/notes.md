# Incremental coding
- The goal is not "what is the solution?", but rather "how do we build towards the solution in an ideal manner?"

Mention to the students that when it comes to live coding, they should not be trying to replicate the same code on their screen and instead be paying attention and collaborating/questioning the code that's being written on screen.

Take notes on important topics or things to remember

This discussion is meant to facilitate a deeper learning of the coding concepts, where as a simple "repeat after me" lecture would not have students discussing the concepts presented in depth.

## DEMO
>Write a node program that takes in an unlimited number of command line arguments, goes through each and prints out the sum of them. If any argument is not a whole number, skip it. Do support negative numbers though.

## What Did We notice about the approach of the demo?

Approach:
-Break your solution into functions as you go
- Write in small (smallest possible executable program) steps
Don't get hung up on "how does ARGV work?" type questions. Not the focus of the lecture. Tell them this but also try to give them a summary and explain that 
- lecture isn't the best way to learn what ARGV is. Reading about, playing with, and speaking with mentors about ARGV is the best way.
- Run linter at some point?
- Use node debug with debugger and cover next vs continue vs step in/out
- More importantly, go over thinking behind HOW and WHEN/WHERE to use this.

- intending code as you go
- Avoid copy/pasting anything

# Problem solving/ Debugging

Problem solving tips
- Errors are your friend, but you have to try and understand what they are saying and not guess
- Typical week1 research path:
    - Google for a question (how do you phrase it?)
    - Stackoverflow is first hit, shows an approach, is it valid?
- I've never seen this weird arrow function syntax before that is in the approved answer, wtf. What does that mean? How do I interpret that?
- Going to MDN to check for other examples.
- At what point should I ask for mentor support? How should the question be formulated?
- Reemphasize: 15m rule (explained on D1 but must reiterate here)
- Reemphasize: don't just say "it's not working" to a mentor; explain first what you're trying to solve and where you are stuck. Even asking for help properly is a skill that will take some time for you to acquire, we don't expect it to be perfect on D2 but we expect you to work towards improving it. -Reemphasize: Code reviews and their importance
